1.
IF(activity_type = 'start', -1, 1):
This conditional logic assigns:
-1 to the start timestamp.
1 to the end timestamp.
This ensures that start timestamps are subtracted, and end timestamps are added in the next step.
SUM(IF(activity_type = 'start', -1, 1) * timestamp):
Multiplies the timestamps by the result of the IF statement.
Adds end timestamps and subtracts start timestamps to calculate the total time for all processes on the machine.
